This is me trying to follow a tutorial. [It's this tutorial here.](https://medium.com/@jacobdiamond/command-control-infrastructure-using-aws-cloudflare-and-mythic-part-1-d9b02354f7b2) The thing is that the tutorial does a lot of clicking with the mouse in a browser and I'm all, like, IaC these days, so I terraformed all the infra for it. I learned a bit. Planning on learning a bit more. Kind of the whole point. It's not exactly the same as the tutorial, but sure like whatever.

WORK IN PROGRESS.
